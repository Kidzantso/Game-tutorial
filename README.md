# Game-tutorial
This readme will be short as this was a tutorial that i followed on the yotube 
https://www.kaaringaming.com/

* I've learnt a new concepts for OOP
* Learned how to organize packages
* Think like a professional game developer

I followed his instructions on YT and made some of the code on my own referring to his vidoes to check what to i need to do.

I didn't add sounds but you can find the whole project on his Github profile.

You can check his website for the game as i can't put any of his resources on my github and this code was mostly made by him and i suggest anyone who is interested in learning about game development using java to see his tutorial.

I will soon post my own game with the whole code written by me and my own images (i hope) but i considered putting this tutorial here as it took alot of time and effort and i believe that learning is also important as inventing and creating on your own and if anyone needs it or interested ,in addition to have an opportunity to thank this great man for his work.
